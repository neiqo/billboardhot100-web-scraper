# Billboard Year-end Hot 100 Songs Web Scraper

This project is to scrape data from Billboard's website and analyze the hot 100 songs from 2010-2022

## Current problems with web scraper script
1. Scraper does not automatically go through all the links for all the years. You have to manually change the link and names for each year you wish to extract.
2. Scraper is lame and is a simple python file that you run in VSC. I want to make a runnable exe that has a drop-down with all the years to pick wich years' data you want to extract
